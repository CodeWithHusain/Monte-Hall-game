1.write the satring variable of the code 
2.assume one cup = price
3.jumble the cups/ variables
4.take input to choose one cups 
5.after choosing ask for swap or not swap
6.first show the user an empty cups then ask the user for swap or not swap 
7. if the user swap then show the user diffrent cups else show the user that cups that it have choosen 
8.then calculate the number of swap and non-swap  
9.show the final results
