# Monte-Hall-game
ðŸ“œ Game Rules:
There are 3 cups.

One cup contains a reward (the other two are empty).

The player picks one cup.

The host reveals an empty cup from the remaining two (never showing the reward).

The player is given the choice to swap or stay with their original cup.

The cup is opened and the outcome (win/loss) is displayed.

The game repeats until the player chooses to stop.

Stats for swaps and wins are shown at the end.

ðŸ§  Monty Hall Strategy Insight:
Swapping gives you a 2/3 chance to win.

Staying gives you only a 1/3 chance.

Over many plays, you'll see swapping wins far more often!
