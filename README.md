# ðŸŽ© Monte Hall Game (Monty Hall Problem Simulator)

A fun simulation of the famous **Monty Hall Problem**, where your decision to **swap or not** determines your chance of winning a reward hidden under one of three cups.

## ðŸ“œ Game Rules

- There are **3 cups** â€” one contains a **reward**, the others are empty.
- The player picks **one** cup.
- The host then reveals **an empty cup** from the two remaining ones (never the reward).
- The player is asked: **Do you want to swap your cup?**
- The chosen cup is opened and the result is shown.
- The game repeats until the player chooses to stop.
- At the end, **statistics** show your results based on swap and non-swap choices.
